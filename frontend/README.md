# COMP2110 Bob's Jobs Frontend

This project implements the front-end code for Bob's Jobs.


I have commented out .env and .tmp files from all .gitingore files so Strapi can work on both laptop and PC

Level 2 spec of cypress will fail unitl the test is ran minimum of 3 times, so when you ran the test the fourth time it will pass
